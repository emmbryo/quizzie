# Phases of development 

1. **Inception & Elaboration**: 
   - Inception involves the initial idea generation and project initiation.
   - Elaboration involves detailed planning, requirements gathering, and creating a more comprehensive project vision.

2. **Construction**:
   - Construction is the phase where the actual development work takes place.
   - It involves coding, testing, integration, and refining the software to meet the specified requirements.

3. **Transition**:
   - Transition marks the final phase where the software is prepared for deployment.
   - It involves final testing, documentation, training, and transitioning the software to users or production environments.

## Inception & Elaboration: week 1-2

## Construction week: 2-9

## Transition week: 9-10
